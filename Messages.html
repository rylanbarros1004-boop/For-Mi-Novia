    <h1>Three Months 💕</h1>
    <p>
      Hi Mahal Ko ❤️, Today marks three months since we started this beautiful journey together.
      This is actually apart of your three months gift.
      These past three months with you have been nothing short of magical. Every single day, you make my world brighter just by being in it. I love the way your smile lights up a room and the way your laughter feels like music I could listen to forever. Even the smallest moments with you — holding your hand, sharing a song, or just sitting together in silence — feel incredibly special because they’re with you. You have this way of understanding me without words, of making me feel safe, loved, and truly seen.
      In these three months, I’ve come to realize how lucky I am to have someone as kind, beautiful, and inspiring as you in my life. You’ve taught me what it means to care so deeply for someone, and every day I find new reasons to fall for you even more. From our late-night talks to our little adventures, every memory we’ve made together feels like a treasure I’ll hold onto forever. You’re not just my girlfriend — you’re my best friend, my confidant, my muse, and the one who makes me want to be a better person every day.
      I can’t imagine my life without you, and I can’t wait to see all the memories, laughs, and moments we’ll continue to share. These three months are just the beginning of something I know will last a lifetime, because being with you feels like home. You’re my dream come true, and I will always cherish every second we spend together.
